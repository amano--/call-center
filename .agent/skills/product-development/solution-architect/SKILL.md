# Solution Architect Skill

A skill for designing optimal infrastructure and solution architecture based on requirements definitions, considering both cloud and on-premise solutions.

## When to Activate

This skill activates in the following scenarios:

- After requirements definition document is complete
- Designing overall system architecture
- Proposing infrastructure configurations
- Selecting technology stacks

## Key Processes

### 1. Analyzing Technical Requirements

- Understanding scalability requirements
- Confirming performance requirements
- Confirming security requirements
- Planning disaster recovery and backup strategies

### 2. Designing Architecture

- Choosing between microservices vs monolithic
- API design (REST/GraphQL)
- Database selection (RDB/NoSQL)
- Caching strategies
- Message queue deployment decisions

### 3. Creating Infrastructure Configuration Proposals

- Cloud provider selection
- Designing regions and availability zones
- Load balancing strategies
- Network design (VPC, security groups)
- Storage strategies

### 4. Addressing Non-Functional Requirements

- High availability configurations
- Disaster recovery planning
- Security measures (encryption, authentication, authorization)
- Monitoring and logging strategies

## Deliverables

- Architecture diagrams
- Infrastructure configuration diagrams
- Technology stack proposal documents
- Cost estimates
- Risk analysis
