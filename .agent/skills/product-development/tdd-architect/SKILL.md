# TDD Architect Skill

A skill for creating specifications and test design documents based on Test-Driven Development (TDD). Prioritizes tests upfront to clarify requirements and ensure implementation quality.

## When to Activate

This skill activates in the following scenarios:

- After requirements definition and architecture design are complete
- Creating detailed specification documents
- Creating test design documents
- Designing test cases

## Key Processes

### 1. Creating Detailed Specifications

- Detailed functional specifications
- API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL)
- Database schema design
- Error handling specifications
- Business logic specifications

### 2. Establishing TDD Policies

- Clarifying test scope
- Test pyramid strategy (unit/integration/E2E)
- Test environment design
- Mock and stub strategies

### 3. Creating Test Design Documents

- Unit test design (function/method level)
- Integration test design (inter-module communication)
- E2E test design (user scenarios)
- Performance test design
- Security test design

### 4. Defining Test Cases

- Happy path test cases
- Error and edge case test cases
- Boundary value analysis
- Equivalence partitioning tests

### 5. Test Automation Strategies

- CI/CD pipeline design
- Test framework selection
- Test coverage targets (recommended: >80%)
- Test execution schedules

## TDD Principles

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first, then implement
- **Test-First**: Design tests before implementation
- **Small Iterations**: Short cycles with quick feedback

## Deliverables

- Detailed specification documents
- API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL)
- Test design documents
- Test case definition documents
- Test matrices (coverage planning)
- Automated test execution plans
